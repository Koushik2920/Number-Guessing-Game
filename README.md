# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. After each guess, the player receives feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or exhausts the allowed attempts.
